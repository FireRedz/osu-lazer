## Introduction

> **WARNING**: The API in under heavy development and has not stabilised yet. If you choose to use it at this stage, you do so at your own risk. Endpoints may appear, disappear, be renamed and completely change behaviour without warning.

## Terms of Use

Use the API for good. Don't overdo it. If in doubt, ask before (ab)using :). this section may expand as necessary.

Current rate limit is set at an insanely high 1200 requests per minute, with burst capability of up to 200 beyond that. If you require more, you probably fall into the above category of abuse. If you are doing more than 60 requests a minute, you should probably give peppy a yell.
